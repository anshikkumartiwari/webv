# webv — Minimal Terminal-to-GUI Web Launcher for any Debian based Operating System (Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Raspberry Pi OS, MX Linux, Parrot OS)


`webv` is a lightweight(8kb package size), terminal-based web launcher built using GTK3 + WebKitGTK 4.1 and C language. Run it from your terminal and get instant GUI browsing — no clutter, just pure speed and utility.

## Install via APT

You can install `webv` directly from the custom APT repo.

Run the following commands:

```bash
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://anshikkumartiwari.github.io/webv/apt-repo stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webv.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install webv
```

---

## Usage

```bash
webv https://wikipedia.org
```
```bash
webv what's the weather toady
```
```bash
webv              # opens https://www.google.com by default
```

---

## Features

- Launch full websites directly from terminal
- Enter search queries and it auto-searches Google
- Minimalist, elegant interface
- Back, forward, refresh, and info buttons
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - Ctrl + L: Focus the URL bar
  - Ctrl + R: Reload page
  - Alt + ← / Alt + →: Back / Forward
- Auto-fallback to google.com if no URL/query is provided

---

## How it works

- `webv` checks if your input is a valid URL
  - If yes → opens it
  - If no → assumes it’s a Google search
- GUI opens in a clean GTK window using WebKitGTK 4.1
- Info button shows shortcut help
